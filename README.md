# Metronome with Rain Sound

A web-based metronome application with customizable speed and optional rain background sound.

# Why

There are many excellent metronomes on the web and none of them works on my 
Fender Mustang Micro Plus because sudden peaks 
in the sound level are suppresses by the built-in noise gate.

One solution for that is to set Background Sounds on a Macbook or iPad. This simple metronome
offers rain background sound together with the metronome clicks.

## Features
- Adjustable metronome speed (20-120 BPM)
- Optional rain background sound
